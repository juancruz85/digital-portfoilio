            <h3>Perpetual Motion Machine</h3>
            <p>
              In this project we challenged the general public's knowledge in
              physics. I had to make a moving wheel with a group of two other
              people and sell it to the masses as perpetual. The way we did this
              was by explaining things with technobabble. Personally for my
              project our technobabble was that the magnets inside our machine
              had dark matter inside them. That dark matter would therefore
              manipulate the magnetic field and cause a permanent imbalance.

            <p>
              In this project I had to write about a story that greatly affected
              my life. Using descriptive writing techniques I put the reader in
              my shoes as life seemed to crumble around me. So join me on my own
              journey of self discovery, and enlightenment as I faced mortality
              itself. Click the button below to read the story...

            <h3>Comic</h3>
            <p>
              In this project I told the same story as I did in my personal
              narrative but in the form of hand drawn images. I used abstract
              art to give each character a unique shape that is easily
              identifiable. I also manipulated the colors to show my current
              emotion and how my world goes from bright to dark.

              In this project we had to graph lines in Desmos graphing
              calculator to create an image. I personally made the decision to
              graph my dog and others did themselves or something else entirely.

            <p>
              In this project I had to research a book that was banned in the
              United States and why it was banned. I personally chose the book
              "Ban This Book". In the book the main character's favorite book
              gets banned and she starts up a library in her locker. The reason
              this book was banned in Florida was because "it undermines school
              board authority."

              In this project I had to disassemble a pull back car that we
              called the "Borth Police". Thank you Vivienne. During the process
              of disassembly we had to document each part of the vehicle and how
              they interact with each other. We then had to present our findings
              through different deliverables. I personally made a presentation
              to my whole class.

            <h3>Flat Earth Lab</h3>
            <p>
              In this project I had to prove that the Earth wasn't flat. I had
              to go do a variety of experiments such as creating a sun dial and
              watching a boat go over the horizon. I had to do all of this in
              order to then debate my Physics teacher on whether or not the
              Earth was flat. Then I made one final lab report representing my
              findings.

            <h3>Identity Card</h3>
            <p>
              In this project I had to make an Identity Card and use graphs to
              represent different misconceptions about myself. I also used this
              as a chance to display a little bit of my silliness. It was a
              great introduction to misconceptions about people and laid a good
              foundation for further projects. Overall this was a fun project
              and a nice introduction to the rest of the project.
